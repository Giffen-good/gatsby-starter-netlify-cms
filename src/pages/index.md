        Alkamind engagements start by understanding the client within a
        developmental model of maturity. Every organism or organization evolved
        through generally distinct levels of maturity. When energy and skillful
        means are focused on the appropriate next steps through those
        developmental steps, the journey is both a fulfilling and rewarding one.

  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
